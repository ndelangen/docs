# If your npm is broken

Reinstall npm:

```sh
curl -L https://www.npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
```

If you're on Windows and you have a broken installation, the easiest thing to do is to reinstall node from the official installer (remember [this note](https://docs.npmjs.com/troubleshooting/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm#upgrading-on-windows)).
